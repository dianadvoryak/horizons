						<span class="post__title">COCONUT OIL BENEFITS</span>
		        <p class="post__text">Coconut oil is among the most popular ingredients in skincare and haircare products, and for good reason: This powerful plant oil is praised as a treatment for everything from dry skin to frizzy hair. It’s been used throughout Asia for centuries in cosmetics and remains a huge part of traditional diets in many parts of the world. You can find coconut oil everywhere, from supermarket shelves to the skincare aisle at your local pharmacy.I We’re betting that you’re familiar with at least some coconut oil benefits—but there’s always more to learn. Ahead, we’re breaking down everything there is to know about this beloved ingredient. You’ll learn where coconut oil comes from, what it’s used for, and how to incorporate it into your beauty routine using some of our favorite Kiehl’s products. Read on for our official guide to coconut oil.<br><br>Coconut oil is a semi-solid oil derived from the dried fruit and raw milk of the coconut palm tree. It has been used throughout tropical regions for centuries as a natural moisturizer for hair and skin and as a folk remedy for various ailments. It also constitutes a large portion of the diet in many parts of the world, particularly in Southeast Asia, where more than 80 percent of the world’s coconut products are produced. Coconut oil is high in saturated fatty acids, including linoleic acid and lauric acid. Virgin coconut oil—that is, oil extracted from raw coconut milk, rather than dried coconut “meat”— is also high in antioxidants, including vitamin E.I Some studies indicate that coconut oil is known to have antibacterial, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory properties, as well. Arguably the most well-known benefit of coconut oil for skin is its ability to moisturize and soften. This is mostly due to how it affects the skin’s natural moisture barrier. Studies have shown that using coconut oil topically can help strengthen the cells that make up the skin’s natural moisture barrier, which helps reduce moisture loss and keep skin balanced. It may also help boost collagen production, which is essential for a plump, hydrated complexion. Additionally, many of the fatty acids present in coconut oil, including linoleic acid, are known for their ability to absorb deep into the skin. This allows coconut oil to penetrate not just the outermost layer of skin, but also the deeper layers, resulting in more effective hydration. In fact, research shows that coconut oil is as effective as mineral oil—a popular hydrating skincare ingredient—when used as a moisturizer for mild to moderate dryness.
