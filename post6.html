						<span class="post__title">HOW TO USE HYALURONIC ACID WITH VITAMIN C</span>
		        <p class="post__text">Hyaluronic acid and vitamin C are each noteworthy in their own right, but put them together and you just might have something even more remarkable. The two skincare ingredients can brighten and hydrate (respectively) when used individually, but Kiehl’s Customer Representatives are often asked whether you can—or should—use the two together in your skincare routine. And these are easy questions to answer. Not only can you use vitamin C and hyaluronic acid together, but when you do, they can help create a more effective skincare routine. Each one has skincare benefits, some of which we mentioned, but when combined, they can form a more potent formula that offers increased results. But, before we get into how they work together, we first need to talk about what each of these powerhouse ingredients is capable of doing solo.<br><br>Vitamin C. There’s a solid chance you enjoy a dose of vitamin C every day—it’s present in more than just your orange juice. Everything from tomatoes and potatoes to Brussels sprouts and bell peppers are good sources of vitamin C. Beyond being present in foods, vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that is also known as ascorbic acid. It’s key to the production of collagen and elastin in the skin and is known to have an anti-aging effect. As a skincare ingredient, it can visibly improve deep lines, wrinkles, uneven skin texture, and dullness. Vitamin C is also an antioxidant, which means it may help improve the appearance of damage caused by UV radiation. It can even block some of the effects of free radicals, which, over time, are largely responsible for some of the visible effects of aging.<br> Hyaluronic Acid. As for hyaluronic acid, this skincare ingredient has also earned quite the reputation for its anti-aging benefits. It’s naturally found in your skin, and one hyaluronic acid molecule has the ability to hold 1,000 times its weight in water. The fact that it’s naturally-occurring in your skin means it’s highly compatible with it, which has made it a massively popular ingredient in skincare products for dry and mature skin. When used topically, its benefits include replenishing skin to boost hydration, improving skin’s elasticity, rough texture, and firmness, and decreasing the appearance of wrinkles.
